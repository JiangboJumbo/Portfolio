## Self Introduction
Hello! My name is Jiangbo Yu. 
I am a Master student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am graduating in May 2024 and looking for opportunities in the field of Control or Robotics. I am proficient and equipped with hands-on experience in multiple programming languages and tools including C/C++, Python, MATLAB and ROS.
## Recent Projects
### Research Assistant @ DASC Lab, Department of Robotics, UM
Mainly responsible for the development and evaluation of the perception system of quadrotors.
* Evaluated, benchmarked and improved the perception algorithm based on feature detection and point cloud registration algorithm on ETH3D dataset and KITTY dataset.
* Employed RGB-D camera and Nvidia Jetson series mounted on rovers to conduct real-world validation of the perception pipeline.
* Integrated Optical Flow method into the perception algorithm and managed to build a certified visual odometry. Used ROS2 for communication and visualization

### Simulation Environment for ASV/UAV Oceanographic Missions
This project aims to develop a simulation environment for testing the informative path planning and control algorithms for multi-agent oceanographic reconnaissance and surveillance operations.
* Built a primary scenario which has an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) and a group of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV) exploring the ocean for data acquisition under energy constraints and varying ocean flows.
* Simulated the motion model of ASV and UAV, implemented control algorithms including LQR controller, Geometric controller. Tested the whole system under baseline algorithms to gain knowledge of the physics and dynamics of ASV and UAV in the ocean environment.

### A BCI-Controlled Robot Arm System Based on Augmented Reality
This project aims to establish a whole system to facilitate the rehabilitation of those who suffer from motion inability. 
* Established the experiment simulation platform on which a virtual robot arm can receive orders from a BCI system and operate as if in the real world.
* Employed OMPL library on ROS platform and use LazyPRM* algorithm to conduct motion planning simulation for the robot arm.
* Introduced the concept of “shared control” so that limited BCI control signals can achieve complicated motions of the robot arm.

### A Cable-Driven Hyper-Redundant Robot with Angular Sensing
This project aims to facilitate the task of pipe inspection with a hyper-redundant robot.
* Completed the data analysis part of the algorithm using MATLAB and C++, completed the simulation of the kinematic model of the robot, optimized the iteration method and parameters of the algorithm.
* Manufactured part of the experiment platform through 3D printing, tested the hardware system, assisted to conduct several experiments.
